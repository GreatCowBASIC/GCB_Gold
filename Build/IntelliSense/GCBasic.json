PWMOff will only shutdown the AVR HPWM channel 2.\n\nchannel described as 1, 2, 3,…​16 correspond to the pins OCR0A, OCR0B…​.OCR5C as detailed in the channel constant table. Channel 1 and channel 6 are not available.\n\nfrequency sets the frequency of the PWM output measured in Khz. The maximum value allowed is 255 KHz. In situations that do not require a specific PWM frequency, the PWM frequency should equal approximately 4 times the clock speed (GCB chipMHz) of the microcontroller (ie 63 KHz on a 16 MHz chip, 32 KHz on 8 MHz, 4 Khz on 1 MHz). This gives the best duty cycle resolution possible. Alternate frequencies with good duty cycle resolution are 1Khz, and 4Khz with chipMhz values of 16 and 8 respectively.\n\nduty cycle specifies the desired duty cycle of the PWM signal, and ranges from 0 to 255 where 255 is 100% duty cycle. The AVR fast PWM mode has a small spike at the extreme setting of 0x00, on most devices, with each period register rollover. By using the HPWM command, and writing 0x00 to the duty cycle parameter, the PWM signal will shutdown completely and avoid the spike. The PWM signal can then be restarted again with a new HPWM command."

PORTB.4), then the direction, which is either In or Out.\n\nThe entire port form is similiar to the TRIS instruction offered by some Microchip PIC microcontrollers. To use it, give the name of the port (i.e. PORTA), and then a byte is to be written into the TRIS variable. This form of the command is for those who are familiar with the Microchip PIC microcontrollers internal architecture.\n\nNote: Entire port form will work differently on Atmel AVR microcontrollers when a value other than IN or OUT is used. Atmel AVR microcontrollers use 0 to indicate in and 1 to indicate out, whereas Microchip PIC microcontrollers use 0 for out and 1 for in. When IN and OUT are used there are no compatibility issues."
