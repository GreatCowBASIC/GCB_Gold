Programmer Editor – Readme

1. Not programming from the IDE?

a) Check Preferences Editor Settings  
- In the Preferences Editor, open the Compiler tab and enable Verbose mode.  
- Use FLASH only.  
- Confirm whether the programmer is being called.  
- If it is not, review your Preferences Editor configuration.

b) Check Programmer Definitions  
- Open the Programmer tab.  
- Do you have any programmers defined?  
- Do you have any programmers selected for use?  
- If not, define a programmer and select it.

2. Not programming with the programmer you want?

a) Reorder Programmer List  
- Open Preferences Editor ? Programmer tab.  
- Ensure your preferred programmer is at the top of the list.  
- If not, drag it to the top.

3. Still not programming with the programmer you want?

a) Check for Constraints  
- Open Preferences Editor ? Programmer tab.  
- Confirm your preferred programmer is at the top.  
- Make sure you have not set any conditions in the USE IF field.  
- Remove any constraints if present.

4. Still confused?

a) Reset to Defaults  
- Download the latest USE.INI from the GCBASIC forum.  
- Replace the existing file in ..\gcbasic\gcbasic
- This restores the default configuration.

5. What do the %% variables do in the Preferences Editor / Variables tab?

- Variables you create can be used in the Programmer tab fields.  
- Anything between percent signs is processed by the compiler.

Common variables:  
%chipmodel% = Name of the chip from the #chip line  
%filename%  = Hex file to be programmed  
%port%      = Port selected in the GUI

Example:  
Compiling C:\Temp\test.gcb for an Uno (ATmega328p) on COM21 produces:

-c Arduino -b 115200 -P COM21 -p ATmega328p -U flash:w:"C:\Temp\test.hex":i

These arguments are passed to avrdude.exe, which programs the microcontroller.

- -c is the programmer type  
- -b is the baud rate  
- -p is the chip  
- -U is the operation

For details, see the AVRDUDE manual:  
https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_4.html#Option-Descriptions

Different programmers (for example PICkit) require different setups.  
If using a predefined programmer, you usually do not need to modify anything.  
If adding a new programmer, consult its documentation.

7. Last resort
