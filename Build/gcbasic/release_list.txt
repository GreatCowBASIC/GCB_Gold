                          Improvement for FOR-NEXT. USELEGACYFORNEXT implemented, improved Integer negative handling[1191,1193,1194]
                          Use `#define USELEGACYFORNEXT` to enable legacy FOR-NEXT support.
                          Improved handling of FORNEXT. Use case all three parameters are Constnts. Now creates tmp variable when loopvar is an Integer[1198]
                          FOR-NEXT - Improved handling of Positive integers when the startValue is lower than the EndValue[1199]
                          FOR-NEXT fix for INTEGER operations[1200]

964    New    Compiler    PIC-AS updates [1201]
                          Compiler tested with PIC-AS 2.32
                          1. Added FCALL and LJMP support. Removal of adaption is .S processing section, now uses AddPageCommands(). CalcLineSize() now includes FCALL and LJMP for code size.
                          2. Added BANKISEL support. BANKISEL is NOT supported by PIC-AS so this adds a macro to the .S to resolve.

                          PIC-AS Support status
                          - PIC-AS works for 18F.
                          - PIC-AS has not been tested on AVR or LGT

                          Known issues.  ALL caused by PIC-AS 2.32 NOT Great Cow BASIC compiler.
                          These issues are slated to be resolved in PIC-AS 2.35
                          - PIC-AS for 10f, 12f and 16f works for small chips but for larger chips Microchip are changing PIC-AS 2.35 resolve the following:
                          * BANKSEL just does not operate correctly. Microchip have accepted this issue.
                          * BTFSx instructions are not working as expected. The BTFSx instruction is a single word instruction but in some cases PIC-AS is expanding this into two instructions. This then causes (in some cases) the PROGMEM page to overflow - and, the resulting HEX is invalid. Microchip have a support ticket on this.
                          * BANKISEL is not supported. Microchip have an open ticket on this to revert the BANKISEL.  This version of the compiler has a script to workaround this.
                          * DECFSZ instruction does not operated correctly under certain conditions. This causes havoc with the page fitting routines. Microchip have a support ticket on this.
965   Fix     ADC         Resolved typo in line 1613[1292]

618     Fix      SPI        Major revision to hwspi.h to support K42.[907]
                            For the K42 type SPI MODULE ONLY hardware SPI only
                            You can specify an SPI baud rate - the baud rate is dependent on the chip frequency!
                            If you get nothing, you have exceeded the SPI modules capabilites, so, slow down the BAUD RATE or use the SPI_BAUD_RATE_REGISTER constant, shown below.
                            The default SPI_BAUD_RATE is 1/4th of the clock frequency in khz. Khz is used to allow for fine adjustment
                            The following example is commented out intentionally
                            #define SPI_BAUD_RATE 32000
                            or, use an explicit constant as show below
                            The following example is commented out intentionally
                            #define SPI_BAUD_RATE_REGISTER 3
                            Optionally, in specific SPI library like the ILI934x GLCDs, you can define the HWSPIMode by using #define HWSPIMode masterfast where #define HWSPIMode is masterslow|master|masterfast
                            This will overwrite the default in the GLCD SPI library. This is so users do not have to change the library.
                            the default is "masterfast"
                            The following example is commented out intentionally
                            #define HWSPIMode masterfast

Changes to Great Cow Basic and Great Cow Graphical Basic since v0.98.01 Release
434    New      PWM       PWM16 for the Microchip 16bit PMW modules! [649]
435    Fix      Compiler  Fixed bug where temporary string variables were overwritten prematurely [650]
                        - Added asm ShowDebug command - anything following this will have any constants replaced, and will then be inserted as a comment into the assembly at that location
                        - Replaced debugging nops in system.h with asm ShowDebug
                        - Temporary string variable sizes are now set based on the string to be copied into the variable - a temporary variable to store "Hello, world" would now be 13 bytes rather than 20 or 40 (depending on the chip).
                        - Command line /K:A switch now correctly passes all input lines to assembly file. Comment lines were omitted erroneously ever since this switch was implemented.
436   Fix      Compiler
                        - Initial compiler changes for floating point/
                        - Added conversion routines to convert between integer, single and double variables. All required conversion routines should now be present.
                        - Compiler now looks for subroutines to do floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but these are not yet implemented
                        - Rewrote code in compiler that handles Repeat command, functionality is the same but new code is much more compact and can be expanded to handle more bytes easily.
437  Fix       PWM      Fix for HPWMUpdate. [651]
438  Fix       Compiler Fix for #Script and ENDIF error. Patched pwm.h.[652]
439  Fix       Comilier Fixes for compiler bugs: [653]
                        - Fixed null pointer exception when the last script line processed is End If
                        - Fixed two bugs in new temporary variable overwriting protection code, one which could cause the same new temporary variable to be overwritten, and one which would lock up the compiler if there was a recursive call.
440  New       GLCD     Added function ReadPixel_ILI9341(x,y ) to library.[654]
441  New       GLCD     Update to PCD8544 GLCD to support hardware SPI.[655]

448  Fix       PPSTOOL  Fix for errant settings being generated[0.5.12]
449  New       IDE      New Xpress 16F18855 Snippet Template
450  New       Compiler Two compiler improvements for PIC: [661/662]
                        - Programmers in compiler settings file can now specify required config settings. If that programmer is used, the compiler will ensure that those config settings are present in the asm and hex files.
                        - If /F switch used to bypass compilation when not needed, compiler will verify that config settings in the already compiled file match those required for the programmer. If not, a recompilation will be forced.
                        - Added /F option to compiler. If specified, the compiler will check for an output hex file with a name matching the input file. If found, and if the hex file is newer than the input file and all libraries, compilation and assembly will be skipped, and any programmer specified will be called immediately.
                        - Tiny compiler change - recognise EXTMCLR config setting as equivalent to MCLR [663]
451  Fix       ADC      Revised a-d.h to support new bit on 16f153xx [664]
452  New       GLCD     SSD1331 GLCD added. The display is a 96 * 64 Color OLED. The driver supports the SPI (hardware and software) mode and all the Great Cow BASIC commands for GLCD and Rotate etc with support for both legacy and OLED fonts [669]
453  Fix       PPSTool  v0.0.5.14. Caching of XML data to improve loading time. Bugfixes relating to pin groups and packages
454  Fix       Dat      18F26K40, 18F27K40, 18F46K40, 18F47K47, 16F19156 dat files updated to handle memory and sort Config. All Dat reissued.
455  New       Compiler One compiler improvement [665]
                        Added new /FO switch to compiler to flash old hex file, whether up to date or not.
456  Fix       Linux    Install.sh improved to handle installation[666]
457  New       Compiler Compiler improvements: [667]
                      - Added ShowProgressCounters option - add to [gcbasic] section of ini file and set to n to remove percentage complete display in verbose mode
                      - Compiler now returns exit code. Exit code will be 0xdeadbeef if errors found during compilation, exit code from programmer if programmer was run, or 0 otherwise.
                      - Compiler will now call appropriate programmer automatically. Add a UseIf = line to the [tool] section, specify multiple programmers in the programmer = line in the [gcbasic] section, and the first programmer with a value useif condition will be chosen.
458  New       RTCC     New library for Microchip RTCC capability.  MicroChipRTCC.h added and RTCC demonstation added to the demo suite. [668]
459  Fix       Compiler Minor compiler fix: use SP rather than SPL on some smaller AVR devices[670]
                        SPL, now it uses SPL if it exists, or SP if SP exists and SPL does not, or skips doing anything to set up the stack pointer if there is no SPL or SP register. This will give correct behaviour on the tiny26 which uses SP for the stack pointer, and on the other tiny chips (11, 12, 15 and 28) which have a 3 level hardware stack that does not require setting up.
460  New       Program  Updated makehex and makeasm batch to remove version numbers.
                        Updated GS+Tool.exe to support new program method

                        - Can now edit UseIf setting for programmers
                        - Compile and Download With menu now makes the used programmer the most preferred one.
                        - Also fixed a GCGB bug, += and -= operations were being corrupted.
464  Update   GS+tools  Updated to G+Stools20171218.zip.  Can now call an additional batchfileaccording to known method: calling parameter is hexini batchfile being called is hexINI.bat Maybe it's useful to accomplish the make-HEX-only task.

467  New      Progfig   - New user interface from programmer management. [673-679]
                        - In verbose mode, compiler now lists programmers as it decides which one to use
                        - If a programmer returns a non-zero exit status, the compiler will generate a warning
468  Fix      Compiler  Minor compiler update: Now shows warning if all selected programmers are skipped due to their useif conditions[679]
                        Updated USE.INI file for defaults
                        Revised PK2CheckPIC.BAT
469  Fix      GLCD      SSD1306 added support for GLCDPrintStringLN etc. Setting variables to zero on print screen
470  Fix      Compiler  Compiler fix: return exit code from programmer correctly again. (Broke in r678) [681]
471  Fix      Compiler  Compiler change to ncrease tool/programmmer limit from 20 to 200 to resolve 'Aborting due to runtime error 6 (out of bounds array access) at line 11956 of gcbasic.bas::INITCOMPILER()' [682]
472  Fix      Batch     Updated UseIni, MakeASM and MakeHEX to ensure the command line switches reflect the use of the ini.
473  New      GCGB      GCGB improvements: [683]
                        - Tabs are now an option for handling multiple documents, as well as the MDI window interface.
                        - Fixed minor bug that could sometimes cause a newly set preference to be ignored until GCGB closed and opened again.
474  New      Compiler  Compiler changes: [684]
                        - Now reads variables from [toolvariables] section of ini file, and makes those replacements in tool exe and command line parameters
                        - In addition to compile time, verbose mode now displays assembly time, programming time and total time, and these are all recorded in the compilation report.
475  New      Compiler  Small compiler change: [685]
                        - Now reads pausetimeout value from [gcbasic] section of ini file. If specified, all waits for a key press will time out after this many seconds.
476  New      I2C       Support for KMode (18F*k42) I2C in Stateful Slave mode. Addition of two libraries and support demo programs.[695]

498 Fix       Compiler  Compiler Bug in long addition on 16F chips fixed, if any byte of the variable being added was 255 and a carry occurred when adding the bytes below, the result would be incorrect.  Also fixes for ENDIF labels could be removed, resulting in assembler errors if Else used. These are now left in place whether needed or not, this makes the assembly a bit messier but won't change the generated machine code. [711]

                       - Invalid mode after Do or Loop now also produces an error message instead of failing silently.
523 Fix       PPSTool   0.0.5.18
                        Update to fix connection problems with sourceforge due to blocking of non secure connections
                        (may require updates/hotfixes to installed .net framework to allow TLS1.2)

                          with these chips but will default to FOSC/4 as the source.  To
                          use any clock source other than FOSC/4 the xlock souurce MUST be
                          specified in the Inittimer2/4/6/8 sub.

                          Added Generic Postscale constants for chips as they are all the same.

                          - Added error message for variable names that start with a number - this usually either a sign of a deeper problem, or a name choice that will cause problems with MPASM.
413    Fix      Compiler  Fix for compiler bug: [621]
                          - Setting the return value of a function by using it as a subroutine parameter did not work
414    New      GLCD      Added OLED fonts to standard GLCD libraries, to use include in your user program.
                          These fonts give you more real estate in terms of pixels and they look cool.
                          #define   #define GLCD_OLED_FONT
                          Supports `GLCDfntDefaultSize = 1`  or 2 where size 1 is 8*5 with Size 2 is 16*10.
                          To access and extended font for GLCDfntDefaultSize = 2, the large fontset, use
                          #define OLEDFont2 OLEDExtendedFont2  'This will provide fontset of 0x20 to 0xFF. This is not included by default as this takes up a lot memory.
415    Fix      Compiler  Improved If statement error checking: An If without an End If now permits further compilation of If statements in that subroutine to detect further errors. [622]

420    New      Compiler  [625] Added #samevar and #samebit directives - use these to show that two or more system variables (or bits) with different names are actually the same variable and can be used interchangeably. Use any name and the appropriate one for the current chip will be substituted.
                          Added ability to set multiple bits in a single assignment command. Add [canskip] at the start to skip any invalid bits. Example: "bit2, bit1, bit0 = 5"
421    New      system.h  [626][627]Changed system.h to correct internal oscillator speeds on 18F2620, and make use of new compiler directives to partially simplify the code
422    Fix      system.h  [628]Updated system.h to change the priority of the setting of the PLL bit.
423    Fix      system.h  [629, 63] INITSYS now handles two true tables for frequency... between 16 and 0.125
                          Test on 18f2425 (type1 max frq of 8mhz) and 18f26k22 (type2 max frq of 16mhz)

294     New     Compiler  Allow compiler to pass chip model to converters [532] and, delete the target file[534]
295     New     Converter Support compiler to pass parameters to converters [533]
                          params = %filename% %chipmodel%
                          That will pass in the filename as the first argument and the chip model as the second
                          (Filename is the name of the file to convert, not the converted file)
                          You can also include anything else in there, provides freedom in calling other programs.
296     New     Compiler  Added new chip capbility for the following chips [538]:
                          16f15325, 16f15345, 16f15354, 16f15355, 16f15356, 16f15375, 16f15376, 16f15385, 16f15386, 16f18854, 16f18855, 16f18857, 16f18875, 16f18876 and 16f18877

270     New     Compiler  New CCP5 PWM functionality [517 & 518]
271     Fix     Compiler  Fix for issue in overloaded functions - compiler was calling the other overloaded version when return value was manipulated
                          Fix for pagesel being assembled incorrectly on 12F1/16F1 chips with 2048 or less words of program memory - gcasm now ignores pagesel on these chips, as MPASM does [519]
272     New     IDE       Updated Syn.exe to the latest release.
273     Fix     Compiler  Fix compiler to improve #option explicit handling [525]
                          Several compiler fixes:
                          Variables that are declared but not used are no longer allocated RAM.
                          - when accessing higher bytes of multi-byte variables
                          - SysPointerX and SysIntStateSave variables no longer generate errors
                          Fixed bug when multiple 0b or H' constants are present on a line - only the first was being correctly translated.
                          Fixed "NLVariable" error message
274     Fix     ADC.H     New capability to support ADCReadX() overloaded functionality.
                          ADReadPreReadCommand new define to support user code insertion
                          ReadAD reverted to 8 bit value (was integer)

v0.95.009 Release
Changes to Great Cow Basic and Great Cow Graphical Basic since Feb 2016 Release
260     New     Compiler  Support for 16f183xx microcontrollers
261     Fix     Compiler  Fixed false errors for #option explicit [491]
262     Fix     Compiler  Fixed for 16f18855 settimer. [497]
263     Fix     Linux     Fixed for Linus installer [499]

265     New     GLCD      New SH1106 GLCD driver and assiocated demos.

230     Fix     Compiler  Improved performance to increase productivity. Massively reduced compilation time!!
                          Fixed bug when two addresses (using @) added as a parameter for a condition.
                          Altered assembler symbol table storage. Now stored as hash map rather than list, which allows much faster lookups. Assembler should be now much faster for large programs [461]
                          - Hashmaps used for constants, and new replacement code is faster
                          Linked lists used instead of fixed size arrays in assembler
                          Timer prescaler constants PS1_1/1, PS1_1/2, etc removed from timer.h. Constants with operators in the name are not supported by the compiler now, but some compatibility code in the preprocessor will allow old timer prescaler constants to be used. [465]
                          Help file updated and timer.h has been changed to reflect these changes.
231     New     DAT       Support for 16f18855 and the assiocated range of chips. Minor compiler and assembler fixes and new chip data to add support for 16[L]F1885x chips [460]
232     New     .H        Support for 16f18855 as follows [455]:
                          System.h
                          I2c.h
                          hwi2c.h
                          usart.h
                          hwspi.h
                          stdbasic.h
                          pwm.h
                          eeprom.h
                          a-d.h
                          timer.h
                          These file ARE required to support the 16F18855 processor range.
233    Fix      FRAM      Updated to improve bit handling
234    Fix      DS2482.h  Updated to improve bit handling
235    Fix      Help      Corrected and improved to remove errors and omssisions.
236    New      a-h.d     Optimisation options.
237    New      pwm.d     Optimisation options.
238    New      TOOLS     Xpress board tool support easy programming.  Simple utility to load hex file into Microchip Xpress board. Will find the drive letter assigned to the board, then copy the specified hex file to it. (Note: Does not validate the hex file in any way!) [459]
239    New      Compiler  Compiler now exposes two extra constants - ChipADC, which gives number of A/D inputs on the current chip, and ChipIO, which gives the number of general purpose IO pins [452]
240    Fix      Compiler  Fix for error when a constant including multiple commands separated by : is used as a command inside a macro [453]
241    New      Compiler  Allow use of hex constants for array indexes in constants[456]
242    New      Compiler  Allow double quotes inside strings - use "" to insert " into a string [457]
                          Allow semicolons inside strings
                          Fix for issue when #include statement indented with tab
                          Variable name checking improved
243    New      DAT       Fixed chip data comparison utility, now ignores comments in chip data files as it should [458]
244    Fix      Compiler  Fixed compiler bug - compiler was overwriting OSC constant from timer.h [463]
245    New      Compiler  compiler improvements:
                          C If compiling for LF type , compiler will use F chip data file automatically if LF file not found. LF files will be removed where they are identical to F files.
                          - IntOn/IntOff changed. These now use a saved status flag in each subroutine, rather than a global counter. Ensure that there is only one IntOff on entry to a subroutine, and only one IntOn on each exit path.
                          - #option volatile bit (where bit is an IO bit, like PORTB.0) added. This causes the compiler to set the bit without any glitches when copying a value from another variable, but will increase code size slightly. [467]
246    Fix      DAT        chip data updated. New chips added, some errors corrected, and most LF files removed. [468]
247    New      Compiler  Compiler improvements [469]:
                          - Bit functions now allowed
                          - Not operator now works with bit variables
248    New      Compiler  Fixes for #option explicit. Compiler no longer generates incorrect error messages for subroutine parameters or some condition checks. [470]
249    New      Compiler  Changes to stdbasic.h after recent compiler improvements.
                          Removed AVR versions of FnEQUBit and FnNOTBit, previous -only versions now compile correctly for both chip families.
                          Comments added that SetWith, FnEQUBit and FnNOTBit should now be replaced by built-in compiler operations. Sensitive pins can be marked as volatile, and native assignment operators will set without glitching, replacing SetWith. Bits are now correctly handled by built-in Not operator. [471]
250   Fix       GCGB      Minor GCGB changes [471]:
                          - Now uses F chip data file if file for  1xLFxxx chip is missing
                          - Fixed bug which created invalid variables when variables created from Parameter Editor window
251   Fix       Compiler  Fixed compiler bugs [472]:
                          - Calculations like wordvar = 100 + 200 + 100 now performed correctly. The first addition was performed based on the type of the input values, not the output variable as it should have been.
                          - ReadTable bug fixed. When the table position was given by a word variable declared outside of the main routine, the high byte of the position was ignored.
252   Fix       Compiler  Fix for bug when accessing elements after position 255 of an array using a variable on  18F [473]
253   Fix       Compiler  Compiler bugfixes for recently introduced errors [474]:
                          - Fix for register bug on AVR - compiler was not recognising which registers could have literals loaded directly, and was loading into another register temporary first.
                          - Fix for bit variable bug when Not operator used in condition
                          - Fix for high bytes disappearing from the result of any calculations in brackets
254   Fix       Compiler  Fixed AVR assembler bug - lds and sts instructions were accessing the wrong location when used to access one of the first 63 IO registers
255   New       DAT       New chip data files for mega32u4 and mega16u4 chips [476]

                                  because the affected chips have no TX1STA register They instead have a TXSTA1 register
                                  and no alias register name in their respective dat files This caused the compiler to create

                                      cd /usr/share/GCBasic
                                      5) Compile the GreatCowBasic:
                                      fbc -exx -v -arch 586 gcbasicbas
                                      6) If no error occurs, you're now ready to run the GCBasic compiler with the command:
                                      gcbasic
                                      7) Enjoy it! :-)
