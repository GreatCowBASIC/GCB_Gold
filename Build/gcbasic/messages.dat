GCBASIC - A BASIC compiler for microcontrollers
Version: %Version%

To compile a file, drag and drop it onto the icon for this program. See
Getting Started with GCBASIC for more info.

Command line parameters:
GCBASIC [/O:output.asm] [/A:assembler] [/P:programmer] [/K:{C|A}] [/V] [/L]
        [/R:format] [/S:settings.ini] [/NP] [/WX] [/F] filename

        /O:output.asm   Set an output filename other than the default
        /CP             Send the default config selected by the compiler to a .CONFIG file.
        /A:assembler    Batch file used to call assembler. If /A:GCASM is
                          given, GCBASIC will use its internal assembler.
        /P:programmer   Batch file used to call programmer, or programmer
                      name if defined in settings file.
        /K:{C|A}        Keep original code in assembly output. /K:C will
                          save comments, /K:A will preserve all input code.
        /R:format       Write a compilation report. Format can be html, text
                          or none.
        /S:settings.ini Specify name of settings file to load
        /V              Verbose mode
        /L              Show license
        /NP             Do not pause on errors. Use with IDEs.
        /WX             Treat warnings as errors
        /F              Skip compilation if up to date hex file found, call
                          programmer immediately and then exit.
        /Version        Display the version of the software.
        filename        The file to compile.

You may use - in place of /, such as -V instead of /V.
